	<p class="bio" id="burn-a"> My enthusiasm for new challenges, professionalism and range of work experience would be a valuable asset to any team. I am always excited to work with new people and learn new skills.</p>

	<p class="bio" id="burn-b">History: 15 years in the music industry, first as a performer, then an engineer, producer, and most recently as a Mastering engineer. Two of the projects I have worked on were nominated for Juno awards. I have also taught audio engineering. The creative side to music is exciting for me, but also the technical aspect of sculpting sound and solving problems. Through these experiences, I have collaborated with a wide range of individuals and groups, which has helped to develop my customer relation skills and build my networks. SerpentOne is the recording business I have run since 1999. I started it as a part time passion, but it grew to a full time dedication. Running my own business taught me the importance of managing my time and managing competing priorities, but also listening to the needs of the artist. Creating an album is a team project, incorporating several people with different skills, ideas and attitudes working together towards the same goal. These are experiences that I can bring forward to any job.</p>

	<p class="bio" id="burn-c">I enjoy the journey of a new challenge, from trying to understand the problem, looking for different solutions, and trying them out. My commitment to doing things well has turned each challenge into a learning opportunity.</p>

	<p class="bio" id="burn-d">Why did I start coding? While I love working in the music industry, I felt it was time for a new challenge. New technologies and problem solving have always excited me, and the creative side of coding intrigued me.</p>

	<p class="bio" id="burn-e">After some self motivated online coding, I took Bitmaker Labs nine-week boot camp. I have always had to keep up on the latest tech and gear in the audio world, but this volume of new ideas was intense. It has led me to a desire to absorb more languages, and refine my understanding of the ones I have.</p>
	<p class="bio" id="burn-f"> Life after Bitmakers - I had a three month internship at Myplanet learning Drupal, PHP, and more Javascript in an Agile mythodology. Using D3, I created an art project that received a grant from the Toronto Arts council. To learn more on this project click <a href = "http://caseysokol.com/?page_id=793" style="text-decoration: none; color:dodgerblue"><b>here</b></a> . I participated in the 2014 "Startup Weekend Library Edition", where my team placed third. I attended the 2015 Hardware Hackathon and FITC Conference. Recent projects have me exploring Virtual reality apps and websites along with spatial audio. I am also tinkering with Arduinos and Raspberry Pi's, building a bluetooth volume control. 
	</p>

	<p class="bio" id="burn-g">I look forward to the journey ahead of me.</p>
